# flightPath
Scenario: 
You have been tasked with navigating a drone through the streets of a busy city.
The city has luckily been designed to have streets in a pure grid, that somehow stretches infinitely in every direction. You have been given a specific set of directions you must use to navigate the drone safely through the city.
Along with the drone you have received a set of instructions on how to use the directions given to you.

Task: 
Your task is to pilot the drone safely through the city, following the directions given to you, and relay the coordinates that you end at.

Part 1: 
Given your input in the file problem-basic-input.txt , follow the directions and record the final coordinates the drone will end it's journey at.

Instructions: 
The drone you're piloting starts in the center of the city; at coordinates "0,0" facing "north".
The directions given to you will contain the following information:
Whether to turn left (L) or whether to turn right (R) by a complete 90 degrees.
This will then be followed by a series of characters that indicate whether you should move forwards (+) or backwards (-).
